==============

Shopping Cart iPhone/iPad app for Drupal Commerce QuickStart

I'm building this out as an example e-commerce app for iOS that works with Drupal Commerce QuickStart. If you're not familiar with
Drupal Commerce - check it out here - http://www.drupalcommerce.org/

Drupal Commerce QuickStart gives you an e-commerce store that's pre-configured with products and prices. Whether you're building an e-commerce app
on top of Drupal Commerce QuickStart, or the rest of Drupal Commerce, you can use this app as a jumpstart for your mobile app development needs.

You will need to install and configure one additional module for this mobile app to communicate with your Drupal Commerce site:

Drupal Commerce Services Resources
